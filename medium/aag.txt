The format of an AAG file:

The file is used to describe a logical circuit.
Each gate is assigned a gate number, while gate number 0 is the constant 0 gate by default.

The first line is the header, which contains information of the circuit, including number of each type of gates, and the maximum gate number.
The header is written in the below format :
aag M I L O A  
While:
M is the maximum gate number (excluding outputs).
I is the number of input pins.
L is the number of latches.
O is the number of output pins.
A is the number of AND gates.

Please note that additional spaces is not permitted.

The following lines are the input pins, which are listed by their literals:

Literals are used to declare whether the singal has been inverted.
For gate number N, its non-inverted literal is 2N, while its inverted literal is 2N+1.
Since input pins are never inverted, the literal is always even.
For example, if the circuit has input gate number 1 and 3, the file would list.
2
6
as the input section.

The output gates of the circuits is always numbered from M+1 to M+O, and in the file, the output gates are listed by their signal source literals, sorted by gate number.
For example, if M=5, and output gate 6 reveals the value of gate 4, while output gate 7 sends out constant 1 signal, the output section would look as follows:
8
1

Following the above is the AIG sections, each line consists the gate literal, followed by their fanin literals.
If the file contains the below information:
8 1 3
10 9 6
It means that gate 4 has fanin constant 1 and the inverted signal of gate 1, while gate 5's inputs are connected to the invert of the previous gate and gate 3.
